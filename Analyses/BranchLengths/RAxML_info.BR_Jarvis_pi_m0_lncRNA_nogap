WARNING the alpha parameter with a value of 10.483402 estimated by RAxML for partition number 0 with the name "No Name Provided"
is larger than 10.000000. You should do a model test and confirm that you actually need to incorporate a model of rate heterogeneity!
You can run inferences with a plain substitution model (without rate heterogeneity) by specifyng the CAT model and the "-V" option!
